âš¡ Fun fact: Most people underestimate the power of our thoughts. Although  hard to believe, our thoughts can have a profound impact on our biology. A compelling example is the placebo effect, where a person experiences a real improvement in their condition after receiving a treatment that has no therapeutic effect. Research has shown that the placebo effect can trigger the release of endorphins, the body's natural painkillers.
